Hi ! I'm Yohan, a 30 years old french Ruby developer.

I currently work at the startup [Sush.io](http://sush.io) based in Paris. I also study a master degree in programming at ETNA.

I'm passionnate about programming, entrepreneurship, music and video games.

For 3 years, I use Ruby on Rails for most of my projects but I'm also a Sinatra enthusiast.

I recently started this blog about my experiences in the developer world. I hope you'll like it.

This blog is powered by [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) and the awesome theme [Mediator](https://github.com/dirkfabisch/mediator).
