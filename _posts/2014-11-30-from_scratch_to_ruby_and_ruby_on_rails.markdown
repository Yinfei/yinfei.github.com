For my second year of programming with Ruby on Rails, I wanted to share with you my experience with this framework, from the first steps to where I am now.

###Heading in a new direction
<br>
Two years ago, after five years spent in the communication and PR business, I started taking coding lessons form a school in france named AFPA. After all this time spent in the classical music media, I became aware of the fact that my career didn't turn out the way I wanted it to, so I decided to set out towards a new world : **programming**.

I used to think that this would be impossible, considering my lack of scientifically skills, but time proved me wrong.

The main reason why I chose programming came from the fact that I have always loved creating things. Since I was a child, I always wanted to invent things and I thought that programming may be the best way for me to quench this thirst for creation.

As you can see, I started with little to no skill : I knew HTML and CSS, nothing more. AFPA taught me the basics of programming, from C# scripts to advanced PHP projects, in witch I had to create a shop-like website for selling books from scratch.

Those are good examples of what you can do to grab some programming skill, ask yourself what kind of tools you need or which things you'd like to copy and try to make it ! It'll help you to understand how things works.
As for myself, hard work, research and guided exercices helped me through this long trial and error process, destined to understand and better my knowledge about the best practices, and pushing my results above those of my classmates. The basis of this motivation was not founded on a misplaced pride, but on the feeling that I was headed in the right direction this time.

Going from writing a fed algorithms on paper to elaborating those projects is what got me seriously motivated to push further and start my own projects, even if i didn't know where to start or which tools best suited them. I recommend you to benchmark the tools you might use : languages, development environments... because the most suited for you they are, the more productive you'll be.

###The Bootstrap sorcery
<br>

>*Have you heard of this &#39;Bootstrap&#39; thing ? It looks awesome !*

That's the newbie I was, one year ago, approaching strange things called "frameworks".

Even if frameworks look georgeous <small class="text-grey">*(most of the time)*</small>, you should take your time and try to do things by yourself. Because those things bring this magic to you, they do all the complicated stuff in the background while you get the benfits from it. The main issue is that you miss how things really work and you get to the next step of developement complexity completely unprepared. Of course you don't have to reinvent the wheel every time you need a car, but try to do it at least one time so that you have the big picture of what's going on.

So there I was, with a handful of small projects made out of procedural PHP in my bag, no knowledge of how to structure my work and not a single idea of how a framework works. First I learnt the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller" target="_blank">Model View Controller</a> pattern, which you should keep a close eye on. Most of the web based framworks use this way to do stuff and it's pretty cool.

Only knowing PHP and C#, my first two targets at the time were Symphony2 and Laravel. Both seemed good PHP MVC frameworks, but two years ago, being brand new at the time, Laravel lacked a reasonable sized community. Chances were that if I encountered issues I'd be all on my own to find answers to fix them. And since I was a complete rookie, it would have been a too risky choice.

After a few tries, I successfully installed a Symphony2 version on my school computer and for the first time I started to see the way you're supposed to do things when you *truely* code. No more "new_file.php" this time, I used my terminal to do things and I must admit : I was completely lost.

###Rage Against the Terminal
<br>
>*"Terminal ? But I wanna do web projects ! That doesn't make any sense at all !"*


Yup. Again, as I said, I *really* started from scratch ! Seeing my black and white terminal again felt like a failure. I wanted neat designs and cool animations this "javascript" thing had shown me, not this prehistoric-looking thing again ! I already had enough of it with the C# scripting !

I was far from understanding that this thing was going to be one of my best friends for the job. Symphony2 had shown me a glimpse of the mechanics, but Ruby on Rails really made me understand that even the coolest tools sometimes require good ol' stuff like this terminal. And even if the results shows on a web browser, the real magic is hidden behind, somewhere else.

About how my choice for Ruby and Ruby on Rails was made, the main issue that I had with PHP at the time <small class="text-grey">*(aside from the horrific amount of dollar signs)*</small> is that I already knew that "every web developer knew how to use PHP". So I took the bet of "doing something else", not to be the coolest kid in town, but to have an additional chance to stand out. Even if there's a lack of developers in our society right now, I felt like I had to do something to have one more chance than the others. I wanted to do something more than being "one more Symfony2 developer".

I had two choices at the time : Ruby and Python. Both looked really cool, had very nice tools, huge communities and were web oriented. Since most of my developer friends are currently rubyists <small class="text-grey">*(and since the very strict look of Python syntax frightened me the first time I saw it)*</small> I chose Ruby.

<span style='color:#CF000F'>Red</span> was my color, it looked clean, elegant and everything about it was saying to me : *Look kid, this is how it's done*. I knew it was the language for me, and I'm not ashamed to admit that it really was love at first sight.

###No pain, no gain

>*"So how does it work ? Let's install Ruby on Rails and figure it out !"*

Let me be crystal clear about it : **DON'T START LEARNING RUBY THE WAY I DID.**
If I wasn't as motivated as the way I was at this time, there would have been absolutely no chance for me to succeed. I litterally began my journey at the end.
If you master the basics in programing and have a very good undestanding of OOP, learning Ruby is not actually that complicated, even though the coolest tricks may require attention. You just have to keep in mind that ruby is object oriented and that every function has now become a method. Just to try to create a few scripts then try to create a gem, have a reasonable start !
But the way I started to learn Ruby was probably the worst : inside Ruby on Rails. Yup, I learnt the two at the same time.
It was an awful idea. Not knowing the full extent of Ruby and all the subtle tricks, I often mistook Rails' methods and Ruby's. Since a framework is supposed to extend the potential of a given language by bringing additionnal tools, you're better off knowing who does what or you'll be confused all the time.
So take your time, learn Ruby slowly but surely, then try <a href='http://www.sinatrarb.com/' target='_blank'>Sinatra</a>, a light Ruby framework, and build lightweight app. And when you'll limited by what what you can do with it, take the big step towards Ruby on Rails !
I insist a lot on the "Take you time" gimmick because, in my case, I may have rushed too much. Try to build you skill one brick at a time, learn small thing and then big things or you'll may be overrun by the missing pieces of the puzzle.

>*"Migrate a database ? Scaffolding ? What ?"*


My *big jump* felt like being dropped in a jungle, naked, with only a spoon at my disposal.
French programming schools never confront you this kind of stuff, they try to convince you that the "web" is PHP websites made with Wordpress or Drupal, which is truely a shame. Because you can't be completely open-minded if you restrain yourself to only doing websites. Being a web developer represents much more than just that. The more you let yourself be sucked in by this logic, the harder it gets to face the challenges of learning a framework. Because yes, doing your "index.php" website was fun but you only caught a glimpse of the very tip of the iceberg.
In my case, the amazing Rails community and awesome tutorials <small class="text-grey">*(like <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html" target='_blank'>this one</a>)*</small> helped me to get myself started. It covers the most basic stuff <small class="text-grey">*(creating a blog or managing simple resources with CRUD options)</small>* and really helps to grasp the basics.

###Create things, share things.
<br>
<center><img alt ="" src= "https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2010/07/github-logo.png" style="height:210px"></center>

After that I created <a href="http://sparkbook.herokuapp.com" target="_blank">Sparkbook</a> . A book collection assistant that helped me to grasp the concepts of relation between classes. Since the "has many through" relation bugged me for a long time, this was a great opportunity to finally understand how to make SQL calls through objects that were related that way.
I also developed a minimalist blog with Sinatra and ActiveRecord called <a href="http://github.com/yinfei/spinel">"Spinel"</a>, you can fork it or clone it to add your needs.
Two years after I started to learn programing, I'm finally able to create things that I can share to people. I try to solve problems while I'm having fun and I hope you'll feel that thrill too. I've never been this excited to wake up in the morning to go to my job.
Thanks to Spinel I've been able to share this story with you and I hope you liked it. Don't hesitate to give programmation a shot if you're curious, computers are less scary than what you think !
And once again : take it easy, go one step at a time.
